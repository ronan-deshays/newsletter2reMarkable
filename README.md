## How it works

*Please note that PAD programmation is self explanatory. The main process is here quickly described, but you can import code in PAD for further informations.*

1. Instantiate Edge and Outlook in Main[flow_and_subflows\Main.txt]
2. Launch every subflow (one for each type of newsletter, see **add_rel_link** )



## Supported newsletter types

### Newspapers

#### LeMonde

[LeMonde](https://www.lemonde.fr/) is a french newspaper. A paid subscription to this newspaper gives access to premium articles and weekly and daily newsletter, which contains a few links to articles sorted by themes.



## How to use

1. Create a new PAD project
2. A Main (empty) flow is automatically created, create following subflows (one subflow for each .txt file in flow_and_subflow folder, except Main.txt) :
    - article_url2reMarkable
    - html_url2articles_url
    - LeMonde
3. Copy-paste text contained in each .txt file, in flow or subflow which has the same name
4. replace "*_here" parameter's values with the ones suitable with your credentials for the differents account mentionned upper.

You should obtain something similar to the screenshot below, except that PAD is in French in the screenshot.

## How to adapt to another newsletter

In your PAD project (follow **add_rel_link** first) :
1. Create a new subflow with a name of your choice
2. Call this subflow in the Main flow
3. Adapt the ```regexp_article_url``` variable to your needs
4. Adapt the "View it in a web browser" parameter (e.g., for LeMonde, it is "Voir dans un navigateur"...) to your needs. It tells to PAD how to recognize the url which will be used to collect every article links.
 


## Alternatives
